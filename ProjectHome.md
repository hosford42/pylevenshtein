This page contains the old version 0.10.1 of the PyLevenshtein library. It should be considered archival only. See the work others are doing to maintain it at https://github.com/ztane/python-Levenshtein/ and https://pypi.python.org/pypi/python-Levenshtein

Levenshtein Python extension and C library.

The Levenshtein Python C extension module contains functions for fast
computation of
  * Levenshtein (edit) distance, and edit operations
  * string similarity
  * approximate median strings, and generally string averaging
  * tring sequence and set similarity

It supports both normal and Unicode strings.

This page exists because the original home page seems to have disappeared. It currently contains version 0.10.1 in both subversion and attached as a download.
